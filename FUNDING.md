# Academic Funding Statement

EDL was originally part of the software project [AcoDyn](https://www.acodyn.com/) which is a flexible computational fluid dynamics software.
During later development, it was decided to release EDLc as a separate OSS project.
As such much of the codebase was written as part of academic studies even though the compiler itself was not the object being studied but a means to an end.
The group under which these studies were conducted is the research group of Prof. Dr. Raphael Wittkowski at RWTH Aachen University and the DWI - Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials.
R.W. is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) — 535275785; SFB 1459/2 2025 - 433682494.
